Screenshot captions (must match the Readme order):
1. Outdated notice examples (warn and danger states)
2. Settings page with thresholds, labels, colors
3. JSON-LD markup example (structured data)

Guidelines:
- Use PNG with transparent background for icons; keep edges clean and avoid dense text.
- Keep banners visually simple with safe margins; avoid text near edges.
- Filenames and indices must match the `== Screenshots ==` section in `readme.txt`.
- Commit assets to SVN `assets/` only; not inside `trunk/`.
